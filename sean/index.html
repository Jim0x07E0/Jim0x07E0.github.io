<h1>&nbsp;Your PC is probably broken</h1>

The page you are looking for might have been removed, had its name changed, or is temporarily unavailable.  But it's probably your fault.  Let's face it - who knows more about computers?  You or the web server?<hr>

<p>Please try the following: <ul> 

<li>Click the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.seanmcqueen.com"><img src="refresh.gif" border=0>&nbsp;<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Refresh</FONT></a> button, as though it's going to do anything different this time.  I'm a computer.  I don't make mistakes. 

<li>If you typed the page address in the Address bar, have another go (but try getting the damned spelling right this time around) 

<li>Open the <a href="http://www.google.com"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Google</FONT></a> home page, and then look for links to the information you want.  And try and pay more attention, this time around. 

<li>Click the <a href="http://www.back.com"><img src="back.gif" border=0> <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Back</FONT></a> button and try again.  Let's face it:  if you're having difficulty with a simple mouse-click, then you probably shouldn't even own a computer.  100,000 times more computing power than it took to put men on the moon, and look where it's got you.  Please don't breed. 

<li>Click <a href="http://www.search.com"><img src="search.gif" border=0> <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Search</FONT></a> to look for information on how to find your own arse with both hands. </ul>
