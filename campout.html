   In May 1999 we went with Sean's cub scout group to Lake Cachuma, 
just north of Santa Barbara.  (The lake is mostly out of the photo 
to the right, and behind the camera).<p>

   Our group had four boys; from left to right were David Vergona (Sean's 
best friend), Sean, Kyle Something-or-other, and Scott.  The adults were me 
and David's father Johnny.  We drove up separately, and never did really 
hook up with the rest of the cub scouts.<p>

   Sean, Scott, Kyle, and David demonstrate that they're strong enough 
to rent a couple of rowboats.<p>
 
   David's dad suggested that the rentals were a better value if 
we rented for half a day, but I pointed out that one hour was 
probably way more that anyone would want to row.  
We returned the boats after 45 minutes. <p>

   This isn't as lazy as it looks, even though the boys were determined 
to row.  There was enough breeze to keep Sean from making any headway, 
so every once in a while I'd have to row us back to the right side of 
the lake.  Scott never did get the hang of when to put the oars into 
the water and when to take them out.  With all the trading places 
we did, I'm amazed that nobody went swimming.

   The boys began asking to light the campfire about 2pm; we held out 
until dusk.  As it got dark it cooled off, but we all had enough to 
wear to keep warm.  After dark we gave each kid a flashlight and they 
played hide-and-go-seek and 'flashlight tag'; I still haven't figured 
out the rules for that one.<p>
 
   David's dad and I had to constantly yell at the kids not to throw 
random things into the campfire. (Little firebugs!)  Between the fire 
and the flashlights the kids had no interest in sitting in the dark and 
looking at stars.  It was a clear moonless night; and the last time I 
saw that many stars I must have been a kid myself, on my grandpa's farm 
in Bronte, Texas.  One time I dragged Sean away from the fun and made 
him sit in the dark for a minute to let his eyes adjust, then I pointed 
out how many stars there were.  He did give an honest sounding "Wow", 
then ran back to the fire as soon as I released him.<p>
 
   One thing has changed about the night sky over the last 
30 or 40 years... the number of satellites you can see with the naked eye.  
I remember one night when I was a kid when we stood outside waiting for a 
satellite to pass overhead.  We knew it was gonna come, it must have been 
on the news or something.  I don't know if this was Sputnik or some early 
American thing or what; but I do remember seeing it pass overhead.<p>
 
   Well, on our camping trip I sat away from the fire with Johnny 
for 15 or 20 minutes.  During this time I was able to see three satellites 
moving against the stars.  It was a good clear night, and an hour or two 
after sunset.  I think that the satellite must have been high enough to 
still be in the sunlight as it passed over our heads.  Nowadays there are 
whole networks of satellites in low earth orbit; what with GPS and 
Iridium phones, and I think the military has an untold number of things 
up there.<p>
 
   One night the next week Nancy and I were sitting outside in the spa 
after dark, and as I was telling her this story, darned if I didn't see 
another one pass overhead right at that moment.<p>
 
   Anyway, on that night of camping we pulled the plug about 9:30, 
and the kids had all had a big enough day that they went right to bed 
(to bag?) and fell immediately to sleep.  I had borrowed a tent from 
Nancy's dad which turned out to be only big enough for the kids; this 
allowed me to sleep in the back of my car.  I'm sure I had the best night 
of all.<p>

   Here it is, next morning, and everybody loves camping.  I guess it 
wasn't cold enough.  I did get to show the boys Tulee Fog raising off 
lake the just after sunrise... Beautiful!<p>

   Sean's most vivid memory of his first camping trip might be the 
coffee percolator.  His reading class had read about one in a story, 
and none of the kids knew what one was.  I guess all the kids knew 
about was Mr. Coffee or Starbucks.  The teacher explained what one was 
and what it looked like... she even sang an old TV jingle well enough 
that I could recognize it when Sean sang it to me. (buppa-buppa-BUP-bup!)<p>
 
   Anyway, I had bought one for the trip when I bought the old 
fashioned Coleman stove.  I was the first one awake, and I started 
coffee brewing.  When Sean came out, he excitedly told me about his 
reading class, then ran and woke the other boys to show them the 
coffee pot.<p>
 
   He made me take this picture of it to take back to his class.<p>

   So overall camping was such a hit that the boys did it in the 
backyard the next Saturday night, and two more times after that.<p>
