   The Homosassa State Park keeps examples of local animals; the only 
exception is this hippo who was there from years before when it was a
private zoo.<p>

   If you ever make it to this area, be sure to stop in for an
unforgettable demonstration of how hippo's naturally mark their areas.<p>

   There's another wonderful state park at Wakulla Springs.  One activity 
there is a boat tour of the wildlife on the Wakulla River.  This is a 
pair of 9-foot aligators.  These boys were less than half a mile downstream 
of the swimming area.<p>

   Sean leaps into 15 feet of water.  This platform is directly next to 
the source of the Wakulla Springs.  Just off the end of the platform the 
water emerges from underground in the bottom of a 160 foot pit.<p>

   At Wakulla Springs they fight a constant battle keeping the water 
free of some kind of foreign water grass.  Every day they have a crew 
wading into the water and loading as much grass as they can into trucks 
to haul away.  The guys were pretty nice, and showed all the kids in the 
swimming area the crayfish that got caught in the grass when it was removed.  
Then these sweet, innocent kids would run and feed the crayfish to 
the bigger fish.<p>

   This was the closest photo I could get of an alligator near the swimmers.  
This one is probably 4 or 5 feet long.  One afternoon as the kids were 
swimming we saw one this size swim off the end of the platform that Sean 
was jumping off of (above).<p>

   The next morning the swimming area was late to open 
because a gator was IN it.  As we waited, a guy came in with a boat and shooed 
the gator out so we could swim.<p>
