This movie <B>does</b> play under Apple's QuickTime program.  
I've tried to play it on Microsoft's Internet Explorer V 4.0,
and the sound didn't play.  If you have this problem, right-click
on the ActiveMovie Control (the movie player), select "Save As" to save
the movie to your hard disk, then play it on the real thing from Apple.
<P>
You can get a Quicktime movie player from Apple <A HREF="http://www.apple.com">here.</A>
