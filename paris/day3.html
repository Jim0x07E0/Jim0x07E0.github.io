<p>
I kept a diary for our trip, because I remember being confused after the London trip.  Here's a summary for Tuesday:
</p>

<p>
Breakfast at brasserie on corner.  Walk to Mom's, Susan already there at 9:15 AM.

Mom stayed in apartment to get sheets from the manager.  Walked with Susan a block south to George Pompidieu center (the modern building with all the colored pipes on the outside.)  Nice plaza next to it, with a large pool/fountain with modern art sculptures in it.  Dogs playing in the water.
</p>

<p>
Continue south to Notre Dame -- another hot day.  Back to fountain, great lunch at café, watching dogs in water -- the coolest spot in Paris.

<p>
Back to Mom's, take her to lunch at café, then back home again.  Kids fall asleep.  Found friendly internet café around corner, send first (and only) photo from Paris.
</p>

<p>
Dinner time, kids still out, Mom not feeling well, three of us have dinner at a nearby café.  Return for kids, on way back to our apartment we got their dinner at KFC.  (Stifling hot inside, and chock full of Parisians -- we were the only Americans inside.)
</p>

<p>
Anyway, we pretty much spent the whole day being tired and jet-lagged.  I haven't seen a photo of the plaza with the fountain, I hope one turns up, because it was a very pleasant place.  I should get more film back today, and the last of it tomorrow.  The three rolls I got yesterday had less than 10 good pictures.

<p>
Today's photo is Sean sleeping through dinner (though I can't swear that it was Tuesday's dinner.)  I took it as a contrast to the London trip, when Scott was the most tired.
</p>

<p>
Love,<br>
Jim
