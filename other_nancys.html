<P>There are at least two references to MY Nancy McQueen,

I thought I had seen a couple of Nancy's before I organized this guide,
but I can't find them now.</p>

I did find Nancy McQueen in Ontario, Canada; who has written a couple of readers reviews for the
<a HREF="http://www.tnrdlib.bc.ca/my-all.html">Thompson-Nicola Regional District Library System</a>, and 
<a HREF="http://www.cluelass.com/ClueBook/CB9703.html">ClueLass</a>.</p>

<P><HR WIDTH="80%"></P>

And I found a reference to a 
<a HREF="http://home.earthlink.net/~mpdavis/gen/d0001/g0000076.htm#I740">"Nancy Unknown"</a> 
who lived over a hundred years ago in Tennessee.  She married James McQueen, 
so they were Jim & Nancy McQueen.  They had four daughters, one of whom was also 
named Nancy McQueen.  (From <a HREF="http://home.earthlink.net/~mpdavis">Mike Davis's</a> home page.)
